## How do I run your projects, João?

## What's Next.js?
- The official website says that Next JS is the React Framework for Production;
- What does that mean?
- Next JS calls itself like this because it offers a lot of features that make building large scale react apps easier;
- Also, it’s a full stack framework for React;
- Super Popular;
- It gives you solution for common problems of majority of React projects;

## React is a library
- Yes! To build complex user interfaces way easier than just using JavaScript;
- You can add third-party libraries;
- It’s really only focused on that user interface part, such as: components, state and props;
- If you want to build large scale React projects, you will have to add extra libraries for routing, authentication, etc;

## Next.js is a Framework
- Build up using React;
- Main difference is that: framework is bigger and has more features than a library;
- It’s focused on more things;
- It gives you clear rules on how you should write your code, structure your files, etc;
- Next.js solves common problems and makes building React apps easier;
- You don’t have to add a lot of third-party libraries, because Next.js already has;

## Summary
- You still write React code, build React components and use React features (props, state, context, etc);
- Next.js just enhances your React app and adds more features;

## Pros of using Next.js

#### 1. No configuration and focus on business logic:
- Next.JS required a minimum or no configuration;
- The focus is on the business logic, not much on the application logic side;

#### 2. Automatic compilation and bundling

#### 3. Server-Side Rendering:
- Next.js got popular because it solved a problem that many web developers used to face with web applications produced on the client-side (in the browser). Single Page Applications (SPAs) boasted improved UX because they required no reloading from the user and enabled greater interactivity;

#### 4. Improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization):
- Since the majority of the content in an app like this becomes available only when it is actually executed in the browser, web crawlers find it challenging to understand the text content of such an application;
- As a result, many SPAs, although popular, remained essentially anonymous for popular search engines such as Google. With Next.js, developers build the JavaScript code on the server during the build time and transmit simple, indexable HTML to the user;

#### 5. FullStack Capabilities:
- You can easily add backend code into your Next.js app. Store data, get data and authentication scripts can be placed inside the same project folder;

#### 6. TypeScript support:
- Automatic TypeScript configuration and compilation;

#### 7. Community Support:
- Next.js has a strong community already. 
- Today, 15th May of 2022, it has these numbers on their official Github repo:
